Is this recording? Okay typing—whoops!—

Just left Opus and I'm not sure what just happeneed to my brain cells. Like, they took my thoughts and ran them through a blender while some kid tried to juggle in the background...which is basically halfway of having a brain 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦ze and finding yourself still chewing popcorn in the closing credits. There was definitely some monumental scene with the protagonist—felt a bit like renovating a house you know will never have enough windows for sunlight but they're telling you it has the perfect feng shui or whatever.

The main actor's face was like that one shade of taupe I can never get right on the wall—endlessly struggling to keep attention while theatre seats silently creak and nag at your lower back, reminding you that perfect posture is a myth as elusive as the logic of some the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮's plot twists. There was this scene, or maybe three... four, can't remember, like a surreal journey through IKEA during a clearance sale chaos with emotionally-charged dialogues sprinkled as generously as the regrettable salt on my popcorn. Speaking of that, I’m not one to wear my snacks, but seriously, did anyone else see the popcorn rain from two rows down? Insane. Anyway, the visuals—like that time I tried to pair velvet curtains with something less... 1700s defenitely.

> Couldn't help myself mid-sentence here, Tessa did tell me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   once it's available. Trust, you'll wanna pause and dissect some bits. It's that kind of opulent madness. Oh, someone's jersey smelled like—what was it? Like lemon sherbet and old kale or something. Sorry, my mind is spiralling like the repeating scene where time froze—it’s like déjà vu but without any warning, you know? 

Honestly can't tell which was more dizzying, the light-headed narrative or the guy snoring mere millimeters from my ear. I came out feeling like I've redecorated a home in a storm—somehow drenched, exhilarated, showing up at your own living room thinking the couch is at the wrong angle now. Such strong visuals tangled with sound that vibrated—no punched—into your seat cushion. Methinks you'll wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just to unravel its cryptic charm.
